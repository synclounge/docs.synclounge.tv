# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

1. An understanding of, or willingness to learn, some basic tech stuff
1. A computer to run these applications

However you decide to run SyncLounge yourself, to run the webapp you need to set the Access URL using one of these methods:

* In settings.json
* Via argument. E.g. - `node webapp.js --accessUrl=http://example.com`
* Environment Variable

## Running

### Docker

The recommended way of running SyncLounge is by using [Docker](/self-hosted/docker/). Docker is an application that runs software in containers making it easier to get applications running. You can learn more by going to [Docker's website](https://www.docker.com/).

If you are running linux, check out [DockSTARTer](https://dockstarter.com/)! DockSTARTer's main goal is to make it quick and easy to get up and running with Docker.

### Locally

You may also run it directly on a machine using a [local install](/self-hosted/locally/).
